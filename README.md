<h1>Objective</h1>

In the highly competitive restaurant industry, understanding the key factors that drive business success is essential for stakeholders aiming to thrive in the market. Despite the wealth of customer feedback available on platforms like Yelp, many restaurant owners and marketers struggle to effectively leverage this data to enhance their business strategies. This project addresses the need to decode the complex relationship between user engagement and business success. By utilizing the Yelp dataset, we aim to investigate how various forms of user engagement—such as reviews, tips, and check-ins—correlate with critical business success metrics, including the review count and ratings of restaurants.

<h1>Metrics Used</h1>

- user engagement
- sentiment of reviews
- peak hours
- impact of elite users

<h1>Insight</h1>

- Out of 150k businesses, 35k are restaurants business and are open.<br>
- Table showing distribution of business success metrics (review count and average rating).<br>
- Data shows a general increase in average review, check-in, and tip counts as ratings improve from 1 to 4 stars.<br>
- Restaurants rated 4 stars exhibit the highest engagement and shows a downward trend for rating above 4.<br>
- The drop in engagement at 5.0 stars might suggest either a saturation point where fewer customers feel compelled to add their reviews, or a selectivity where only a small, satisfied audience frequents these establishments.


<h1>Recommendations</h1>

• Collaborating with elite users and leveraging their influence can amplify promotional efforts, increase brand awareness, and drive customer acquisition.<br>
• Cities with high success scores presents opportunities for restaurant chains to expand or invest further<br>
